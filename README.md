# GCCompiler

GÄ™balang is a simple imerative language based on i have no idea what. Let me introduce a *a new georgus compiler* of this awesome language - **GCCompiler**.

## Compile sources

Source files are located in `./compiler` directory. To compile the compiler by yourself you will need:

| tool  | version |
|-------|---------|
| flex  | 2.6.4   |
| bison | 3.0.4   |
| g++   | 7.3.0   |
| make  | 4.1     |

To compile program from sources, just run command `make` or `make compiler` in `./compiler` folder. Your compiler will appear in `./out` directory.

## Run your first program

You will find language documentation in `./data/docs.pdf` file. Sample programs are located in `./compiler/programs/` folder.

To compile a program run command `./compiler input_file output_file`.
Output file will appear. You can run your program using interpreter located in `./interpreter` directory. To compile interpreter run `make maszyna-rejestrowa`. Run it with your output file as an argument. Thats it!
